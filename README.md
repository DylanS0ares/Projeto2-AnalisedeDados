This project was intentionally designed to understand how to solve basic problems in data analysis.
Itâ€™s important to explore how to proceed in certain situations using libraries like pandas and SQL. 
The final stage was extremely important because it required more than just using Python and the aforementioned libraries. 
It also involved interpreting the connection between a programmer's logic and a real-world problem.
Furthermore, I used Jupyter Notebook to make the process smoother and clearer compared to using IDEs like Visual Studio or others.
It proved to be effective because every problem I encountered could be solved instantly by reloading the project.
